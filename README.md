ESPFlasher Adapter
==================

Header adapter that accepts a 1x6 2.54mm ESPFlash header (as used on
the ESPFlasher) and provides matching connections for:

 * 1x6 1.27mm
 * 2x3 2.54mm
 * 2x3 1.27mm

This allows an ESPFlasher to connect to target boards that use these
alternative ESPFlash header formats.
